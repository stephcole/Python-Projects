<h5>Nice or Mean</h5>
  Nice or Mean is a basic text-based computer game. When playing the game, the user is asked a short series of questions, and based on the answers given the computer decides if the user is nice or mean.

<h5>File Transfers</h5>
  Utilizing tkinter I created a GUI designed to act as an interface for users to transfer files from one directory to another. This was formatted to be able to take on  conditions, such as time and date when deciding which files are to be transfered. 

<h5>Phonebook</h5>
  This project acts as a typical phonebook. The user adds the contact's name, phone number, and email address into a database, where it is stored until the user decides otherwise.

<h5>Class Sign Up Website</h5>
This project brings the user to a website, where they make choices in regards to different classes to take. The user can choose the class subject, as well as the campus they would like to attend. I created this projecy utilizing django.

<h5>Checkbook</h5>
  Utilizing Django, I created a website that acts imitates a real checking account page. The user has a sign in, account page, and transaction page.
